        <p>Hello Everyone! I am from Idaho Falls and am living in Rexburg for school!</p>
        <p>I am currently studying Computer Information Technology and am very excited to learn in this class. I love to surf in the summer and ski in the winter! Technology and softare have always been interesting to me and a big passion of mine. I love the people at BYUI and how well the classes are structured in my experience. I hope to gain a broader knolwedge of software and hope that I can find more passions in technology and narrow down what I would like to do later in life from this class!</p>
